## HTML

    - HTML gives "meaning" to text using tags so that the browser can style/display the content in a structured way.

### Basic HTML Structure

-   The structure of an HTML document
    -   The `DOCTYPE`
    -   The outer `<html>`
    -   The `<head>`
        -   Types of things that go in the `<head>`:
            -   `<meta>` tags
            -   `<title>`
            -   `<link>`
            -   `<script>`
            -   `<style>`
    -   The `<body>`
        -   Where all the content lives

### Elements Give Text Meaning

-   Discuss the semantic value of things like `<h1>` and `<p>`.
-   You can use CSS to style things however you want, but the semantics of the markup are important.
-   Basically, use the write element for the job!

### Two Broad Categories of Elements

-   Inline
-   Block

### Nesting Elements

-   Examples of nesting inline elements inside of block elements

-   Don't display on the page

### Lists

### Headings
