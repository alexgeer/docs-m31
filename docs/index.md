# CWHQ Documentation

Welcome to the CodeWizardsHQ documentation page! 

This documentation is a reference for most of the libraries and languages we use in CodeWizardsHQ courses. It is not meant to be an exhaustive reference, but rather a handy tool that covers the basics. You'll find links to further reading throughout if you want to explore a topic in more detail. 

## Usage

Use the navigation menu on the left-hand side of the page to browse the available documentation. Each documentation section will have a table of contents on the right-hand side for easy browsing of the major topics contained in the section.

You can also use the <em>Search</em> bar if you have a specific topic in mind.

## Contributing

This documentation is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/codewizardshq/docs/) and is open source, which means you can contribute directly if you find and issue or want to add a missing topic. 

If you're not comfortable with making changes yourself, you can file an issue [here](https://github.com/codewizardshq/docs/issues) and someone will either implement your suggestions or reject them with comments.
