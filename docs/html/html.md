# HTML Language

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to define the structure of a webpage. Think of it like the frame of a house. When you visit a website, an HTML page is what the browser parses to display all of the content on the page!

We use HTML in the following courses at CWHQ:

In this section of our documentation, you'll find references to most of the core HTML language features that we use in our CodeWizardsHQ courses.

You'll also find many _Further reading_ sections, which pull from this excellent HTML resource:
