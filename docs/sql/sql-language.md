# SQL Language

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to interact with databases. We use SQL in the following courses at CodeWizardsHQ:

| Middle School       | High School                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Intro to Databases  | APIs and Databases               |
| Mastering APIs      | Professional Web App Development |
| Mastering Databases | Capstone 2                       |
| Capstone 3          | Mastering MVC Framework          |
|                     | Object Relational Mapping        |
|                     | Capstone 3                       |

In this section of our documentation, you'll find references to most of the core SQL language features that we use in our CodeWizardsHQ courses. All of our courses interact with databases using Python + SQL, so we'll show the core SQL syntax first and then give a working example in Python.

You'll also find many _Further reading_ sections, which pull from these excellent SQL/Python resources:

-   [SQLite Tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)
-   [Python.org Documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/)
