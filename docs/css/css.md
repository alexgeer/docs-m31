# CSS Language

CSS (Cascading Stylesheets) is used to define the style of a webpage. Think of it like the choice of paint, wood, window curtains, etc. when building a house. When you visit a website, the CSS is what the gives the webpage its fancy design!

We use CSS in the following courses at CWHQ:
