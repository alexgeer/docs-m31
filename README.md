# CodeWizardsHQ Documentation

Welcome to the CodeWizardsHQ documentation page! 

This documentation is a reference for most of the libraries and languages we use in CodeWizardsHQ courses. It is not meant to be an exhaustive reference, but rather a handy tool that covers the basics. You'll find links to further reading throughout if you want to explore a topic in more detail. 

## Usage

Visit the site [here](https://codewizardshq.github.io/docs/) to browse the documentation. 

## Contributing

This documentation is open source, which means you can contribute directly if you find and issue or want to add a missing topic. 

If you're not comfortable with making changes yourself, you can file an issue [here](https://github.com/codewizardshq/docs/issues) and someone will either implement your suggestions or reject them with comments.
