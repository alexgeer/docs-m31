# TODOs

## Browser APIs and jQuery


### Browser Dev Tools

-   Something about how to use the `Elements` tab to adjust HTML and styling

<hr>

## HTML

    - HTML gives "meaning" to text using tags so that the browser can style/display the content in a structured way.

### Basic HTML Structure

-   The structure of an HTML document
    -   The `DOCTYPE`
    -   The outer `<html>`
    -   The `<head>`
        -   Types of things that go in the `<head>`:
            -   `<meta>` tags
            -   `<title>`
            -   `<link>`
            -   `<script>`
            -   `<style>`
    -   The `<body>`
        -   Where all the content lives

### Elements Give Text Meaning

-   Discuss the semantic value of things like `<h1>` and `<p>`.
-   You can use CSS to style things however you want, but the semantics of the markup are important.
-   Basically, use the write element for the job!

### Two Broad Categories of Elements

-   Inline
-   Block

### Nesting Elements

-   Give examples of nesting inline elements together
-   Examples of nesting inline elements inside of block elements

### Single-Tag Elements

-   `<img>`
-   `<link>`

### Attributes

-   Those with values
-   Boolean attributes

### HTML Comments

-   Useful for making notes in a source file
-   Can also use them to "turn off" some code
-   Don't display on the page

### Lists

-   `<ul>`
-   `<ol>`

### Headings

-   List all of them
-   Should only have one `<h1>` per webpage

### Body Text

-   `<p>`
-   `<span>`
    -   Usually embedded in a `<p>` as a hook for special styling or JS
-   `<em>`
-   `<strong>`

### Links

-   `<a>`
    -   Show embedded and block-level links
-   Show how to link to document fragments using IDs
-   Absolute vs. relative URLs

### Containers

-   `<div>`

### Forms

-   `<form>`
-   `<input>`
    -   Show different `type`s of them
-   `<select>`

### Buttons

-   `<button>`

### Images

-   `<img>`
-   `<figure>`

### Video

-   `<video>`

### Directory Navigation

-   Show how to add different resources using `<img>` and `<video>` that live in different places in a project, such as:
    -   Project root
    -   Nested folder
    -   Parent folder

### Line Breaks

-   `<br>`
-   `<hr>`

### Tables

<hr>

## CSS

### Ways To Include CSS In HTML
- Always in the `<head>`
    - As an external stylesheet with the `<link>` tag
    - Using the `<style>` tag

  

### CSS Rule Basics
- Selectors
- Body
    - Declarations
        - Property/Value pairs
 

### Selectors
- Element
- Class
- ID
- Element+class (`span.my-class`)
- Targeting multiple selectors (`p, li {}`)
- Combinators
    - Descendent combinator (`p em`)
    - Adjacent sibling combinator (`h1 + p`)


### Changing Elements Based On State
- `:link`
- `:hover`
- `:visited`
